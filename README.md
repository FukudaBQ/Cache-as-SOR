# Cache-as-SOR
## Something to Say Before I Ever Started
This may be the first time Simon, and I have ever tried to contribute something serious to the github community, so we are both nervous and excited about this. Simon and I are both software engineers who don't get too much self-satisification from current work and want to do something we can be proud of. I come up with this idea of building a working cache-as-sor because I am sick of my current project at work where we use cache-aside model and our caching strategy is dumb as hell.
